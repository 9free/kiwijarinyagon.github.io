                <h1>Greetings visitors!</h1>
                <p>Hi, I'm Jarinyagon CHANTAWANNAKUL. You can call me Kiwi! I started this 
                    self-initiated exhibition to showcase myself to the world (in case someone interested in my work hehe) and practice coding at the same time. 
                    BTW, Welcome to my exhibition!
                </p>

                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>I am from a small province named "Phitsanulok". If you know Chiang Mai and Bangkok, my city is located in the middle of these two.
                    Since I was young, I have always been told to like Science and Mathematics, so I studied in Science-Mathematics program in high school. 
                    Until now I ended up studying Ph.D. Biomedical Engineering at The Chinese University of Hong Kong. <br><br>

                    However, I am not really into Science and Mathematics, so I am trying to find my passion in life.
                    I am currently interested in arts and design, so I work on my art and design skills in my free time. 
                    This involves learning how to use design software, practicing drawing, and exploring different art styles.
                    I also enjoy photography and videography, capturing moments and creating visual stories. <br><br>

                    I also love to travel and explore new places, which helps me see the world from different perspectives.
                    Through travelling, I also learned about different cuisines, which later inspired me to try cooking and baking. 
                    I will also share my travel experiences and recipes on this website. <br><br>

                    I have been a big fan of music since I was born, and I love to sing. I listen to song from multiple genres and countries, 
                    like Thai, English, French, Japanese, Korean, Chinese, and more. With this kind of exposure, I tried to learn languages through lyrics and songs.
                    I currently can speak Thai, English, a little bit of Korean, and a little bit of Chinese. 
                    I hope to become fluent in these languages and learn more in the future. <br><br>
